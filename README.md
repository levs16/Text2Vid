# Get started:
Install requirements: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Converting:
Syntax: ```python3 main.py <filename> [repeat_count (0 or 1)]```, example: ```python3 main.py example.txt 1``` - will create a video out of contents of file ```example.txt``` and repeat the encoded contents 1 time, default if always 1, so it is not required, but if you want no repeats, set it to **0**
